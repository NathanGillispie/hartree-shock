# Hartree-Shock âš¡

This is my repo for my Programming in Chemsitry class.

The `hf` dir contains my final project. Test it by running `pytest` in that dir. Currently, only restricted hartree fock is implemented. The SCF guess is made using the core guess.

The goal is to be able to display isosurfaces of molecular orbitals with generalized hartree fock.
